# Personal-diary-website-using-Ejs-Node.js-Express.js

In this Node.js project, a fully functional personal blog or diary website has been created with three key pages: home, about us, and contact us. EJS partials are used for efficient content generation. The home page displays blog posts chronologically with brief previews, leading to dedicated pages for each post upon clicking "read more." A hidden composition page allows easy post creation, dynamically integrated into the home page and generating unique URLs for individual posts using EJS. This approach ensures a seamless and engaging user experience, combining technical sophistication with user-centric design.
